# Final-Project
Final Project from Career Foundry Bootcamp on Crime in NSW

This project looked at 
  - How crime rates have changed over the years.
  - See the effect of the pandemic on crime.
  - Discover if there are any links between socio-economic status and crime. 

Initial findings were done in Python and then a tableau dashboard was created.
